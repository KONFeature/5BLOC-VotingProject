## Initial setup

First, you need to [download](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/) and install Geth.

## Goerli setup

Create an account:

```console
geth --goerli account new
```

Then we need to populate `eth` into our address. We need to go on the goerli faucet website [https://goerli-faucet.slock.it/](https://goerli-faucet.slock.it/) and to type our address in the required field.

When you have your goerli account, with the ETH on it, you will need to import it in MetaMask. To do this, open MetaMask extension on your browser, choose the "Goerli testnet" in the network list. Then click on import account, choose from JSON File, pick the file generated by geth command above and enter your passphrase.

## Upload the contract on the goerli testnet

You need to create a new account on [https://infura.io/](https://infura.io/), this will give you a safe wallet and an API that can communicate with Goerli. Infura is the prefered way to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain (In february 2019, 63% of all Dapps was posted wis infura)

When you have your account, create a new env file with your MNEMONIC and API key.

```ini
MNEMONIC="some word that compose your mnemonic"
INFURA_API_KEY="xxxx"
```

Then, in a new terminal:

```console
truffle migrate --network goerli
```

This will run the migration and deploy them into the Goerli network. When it will be completed, the address given to the contract will be stored in the ABI file, and the MonkeyElectionDapps will find the correct address corresponding the network you chose in metamask.
